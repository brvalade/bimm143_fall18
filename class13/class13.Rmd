## Get HIV-Pr structure from PDB database
 We are working with 1HSG
```{r}
library(bio3d)
HSG.pdb <- get.pdb("1hsg")
```
Read this in to R and examine composition 
```{r}
hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```
Split in to protein and ligand
```{r}
protein <-trim.pdb(hiv, "protein") 
ligand <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")
```
```{r}
protein
```
```{r}
write.pdb(protein, file="1hsg_protein.pdb")
```
```{r}
ligand
```

```{r}
write.pdb(ligand,"1hsg_lligand.pdb")
```
